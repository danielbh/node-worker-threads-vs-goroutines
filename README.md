# node-workers-vs-goroutines

This is a comparison between node 14 LTS worker threads and goroutines. We will compare:

* Performance
* Resource overhead
* Handling locks and modifying shared memory space between threads or goroutines
* General code maintainability and ease-of-use.

## Performance

* single threaded node
* worker-threads
* single threaded go
* goroutines

## Resource Overhead

* memory overhead
* cpu overhead

## Handling Shared Memory

* Comparison of synchronization primatives
* Comparison of message passing

## General code maintainability and ease-of-use

* Philosophy
